# Rules
1. Do not work on the master branch. Create a separate branch and create a pull request as necessary. Even if we're working on the same thing on the same working branch â€” do not work on master branch.
2. Following rule 1, create any branch you want to do whatever.
3. Document everything along the way. If something doesn't work, we can see each other's intentions so we can fix it.
